# 🚀 Entrepreneurship Support Portal

> *“The people who are crazy enough to think they can build the next startup revolution are the ones who actually do.”*

Welcome to **Entrepreneurship Support Portal**, a next-generation platform built to empower **early-stage founders** with **knowledge, guidance, and tools** to turn ideas into sustainable ventures.
It’s more than just a web app — it’s a **digital co-founder**, crafted with precision and powered by **AI, modern tech, and community intelligence**.

## 🌍 Vision

Most founders quit before they start — not because they lack ideas, but because they lack direction.
This platform bridges that gap by combining **AI-powered Q&A**, **modular learning**, and **founder-friendly resources**, giving every entrepreneur a clear roadmap, expert insights, and real execution tools.

Think of it as **CRED meets Y Combinator’s Startup School**, built for the **Indian ecosystem**.
